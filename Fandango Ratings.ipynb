    "# Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest ([Fandango](https://www.fandango.com) is an online movie ratings aggregator). He published his analysis in [this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) — a great piece of data journalism that's totally worth reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hickey found that there's a significant discrepancy between the number of stars displayed to users and the actual rating, which he was able to find in the HTML of the page. He was able to find that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The actual rating was almost always rounded up to the nearest half-star. For instance, a 4.1 movie would be rounded off to 4.5 stars, not to 4 stars, as you may expect.\n",
    "- In the case of 8% of the ratings analyzed, the rounding up was done to the nearest whole star. For instance, a 4.5 rating would be rounded off to 5 stars.\n",
    "- On one occasion, a movie was rounded up to an entire star, from a rating of 4 to a rating of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/288/s1gp_actual_vs_displayed.png \"Rating comparison\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The two distributions are displayed using a simple line plot. The variable being examined is the *movie rating* (ranked from 0 to 5 stars), measured by relative frequency (percentage) on the y-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both distributions are strongly left skewed, suggesting that movie ratings on Fandango are generally high or very high. The *Actual rating* distribution clearly appeared on the left of *Fandango rating*, implying that Fandango inflates the movie ratings under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/288/s1gp_fdg_stars.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fandango's officials replied that the biased rounding off was caused by a bug in their system rather than being intentional, and they promised to fix the bug as soon as possible. Presumably, this has already happened, although we can't tell for sure since the actual rating value doesn't seem to be displayed anymore in the pages' HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in this project, we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we have ready-made data for both these periods of time:\n",
    "- Walt Hickey made the data he analyzed publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango). We'll use the data he collected to analyze the characteristics of Fandango's rating system previous to his analysis.\n",
    "- One of Dataquest's team members collected movie ratings data for movies released in 2016 and 2017. The data is publicly available [on GitHub](https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17) and we'll use it to analyze the rating system's characteristics after Hickey's analysis."

It is not, mostly because these samples are subject to temporal trends — e.g. movies in 2015 might have been outstandingly good or bad compared to other years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both these authors had certain research questions in mind when they sampled the data, and they used a set of criteria to get a sample that would fit their questions. Their sampling method is called purposive sampling (or judgmental/selective/subjective sampling). While these samples were good enough for their research, they don't seem too useful for us.\n",

    "### Changing the Goal of our Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we have at least two alternatives: either we collect new data, or we change the goal of our analysis by placing some limitations on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decide on the latter. Instead of trying to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis, our new goal is to determine whether there's any difference between Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2015 and Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2016. This new goal should also be a fairly good proxy for our initial goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Isolating the Samples We Need\n",
    "\n",
    "With this new research goal, we have two populations of interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All Fandango's ratings for popular movies released in 2015.\n",
    "- All Fandango's ratings for popular movies released in 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to be clear about what counts as popular movies. We'll use Hickey's benchmark of 30 fan ratings and count a movie as popular only if it has 30 fan ratings or more on Fandango's website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although one of the sampling criteria in our second sample is movie popularity, the sample doesn't provide information about the number of fan ratings. We should be skeptical once more and ask whether this sample is truly representative and contains popular movies (movies with over 30 fan ratings).\n",
    "\n",
    "One quick way to check the representativity of this sample is to sample randomly 10 movies from it and then check the number of fan ratings ourselves on Fandango's website. Ideally, at least 8 out of the 10 movies have 30 fan ratings or more."

    "The left skew suggests that movies on Fandango are given mostly high and very high fan ratings. Coupled with the fact that Fandango sells tickets, the high ratings are a bit dubious. It'd be really interesting to investigate this further — ideally in a separate project, since this is quite irrelevant for the current goal of our analysis.\n",

    "The slight left shift of the 2016 distribution is very interesting for our analysis. It shows that ratings were slightly lower in 2016 compared to 2015. This suggests that there was a difference indeed between Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2015 and Fandango's ratings for popular movies in 2016. We can also see the direction of the difference: the ratings in 2016 were slightly lower compared to 2015.\n",
